 * @brief The ConditionVariable class
 * This class implements a condition variable.  This is a synchronization object that
 * allows multiple threads to block, each waiting for specific signals unique to them.
 * Access to the specified condition is guarded by a mutex that is supplied by the
 * caller.  This object can permit multiple waiters that can be unblocked one-at-a-time
 * via signalling, or unblocked all at once via broadcasting.  This object is built upon
 * lower-level primatives, and is somewhat more heavyweight than the primative types
 * supplied by the kernel.
